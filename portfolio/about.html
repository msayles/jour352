    <p>My name is Megan Sayles, and I am a junior at the University of Maryland in
    College Park. I am currently pursuing a degree in both multiplatform journalism
    and government and politics. I expect to graduate in May 2021.</p>
   <p>In addition to my school work, I am currently interning at <i>Baltimore</i> magazine,
    a monthly print publication with a regularly updated website. There, I am an
    editorial intern. Some of the things I do, include fact-checking articles, contributing
    to online stories, writing event listings, and writing metro stories for the print magazine.</p>
   <p>Besides my internship, I have written and copy edited for miscellaneous
    publications on campus, including
    <i>Stories Beneath the Shell</i>, <i>The Black Explosion</i>, <i>Unwind Magazine</i>, and <i>Her Campus</i>. I'm also
    a university tour guide. Additionally, last summer, I freelanced for my town newspaper,
  <i>The Pasadena Voice.</i></p>
   <p>In my free time, I like to spend time with my friends and family. I love playing the piano
    and singing, and I pretty much listen to music 24/7. I also enjoy trying new food spots and
    playing sports.</p>
