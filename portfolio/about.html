  <p>My name is Megan Sayles, and I am in my third year at the University of Maryland in
    College Park. I am currently pursuing a degree in both multiplatform journalism
    and government and politics. I expect to graduate in May 2021.</p>
  <p>In addition to my school work, I am currently interning at Baltimore magazine,
    a monthly print publication with a regularly updated website. There, I am an
    editorial intern. Some of the things I do, include fact-checking articles, contributing
    to online stories, writing event listings, and writing metro stories for the print magazine</p>
  <p>Besides my internship, I have written and copy edited for miscellaneous
    publications on campus, including
    Stories Beneath the Shell, The Black Explosion, Unwind Magazine, and Her Campus. I'm also
    a university tour guide. Additionally, last summer, I freelanced for my town newspaper,
  The Pasadena Voice.</p>
  <p>In my free time, I like to spend time with my friends and family. I love playing the piano
    and singing, and I pretty much listen to music 24/7. I also enjoy trying new food spots and
    playing sports</p>
