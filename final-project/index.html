      <p>When Alexandra Glover attended Paint Branch High School in Montgomery County,
      she and many of her fellow classmates were people of color. Even with the diverse
      student body, Glover’s teachers were primarily white, despite the school  having
      many teachers of color, according to Glover. </p>

      <p>Now, after three years at the University of Maryland, Glover has had few
      teachers who share her race, and the ones she has had teach African American studies
      or other diversity and cultural classes.</p>

      <p>“Unfortunately the way the education program is, [students] are used to white
      teachers,” Glover said. “This is just the way it is.” For Glover, every race except
      white is underrepresented in the university’s faculty, and its data on demographics
      proves that.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.irpa.umd.edu/CampusCounts/Employees/employeesumm.pdf">
      According to a 2019 Campus Counts assessment,</a> UMD’s faculty comprised
      274 African Americans, 533 Asian Americans and 210 Latin Americans in 2019, while
      there were 2,633 white faculty members. Overall, the minority population of faculty
      is 43.7% compared to <a href="https://irpa.umd.edu/CampusCounts/Enrollments/stuprofile_allug.pdf">43.6%</a> for the student population,
      but there are disparities between races. The assessments found that while 11.5% of students are Black or African American, only 5.9% of
      faculty is. Similarly, 9.3% of students are Hispanic and only 4.5% of faculty is.</p>




      <p><a href="https://issuu.com/umaryland/docs/22628">UMD's strategic plan for diversity,</a> published in 2012, highlights the importance of
      students being exposed to different perspectives and interacting with people from
      different races, but the flagship struggles with recruiting minority faculty. Although the yearly Campus Counts assessments illustrate that
      minority faculty numbers are increasing, the diversity of the student body is underrepresented
      in the faculty population.</p>

      <p>For those faculty that are of color, there has been some dissatisfaction during their
      time at the university. In UMD’s most recent <a href="https://www.advance.umd.edu/sites/default/files/University%20of%20Maryland%20Faculty%20Work%20Environment%20Survey%202015%20Executive%20Summary%20FINAL.pdf">
      Faculty Work Environment Survey,</a> it was
      found that almost 58% of surveyed faculty of color “believe they have to work harder
      than some of their colleagues to be perceived as a legitimate scholar.” Faculty of
      color were also less likely to agree that their department makes “genuine efforts to
      recruit female faculty and faculty of color,” according to the 2015 survey. Most
      importantly, surveyed faculty of color were less satisfied than white faculty with
      the diversity on UMD’s campus.</p>

      <p>While Glover thinks the university should prioritize having a diverse faculty,
      she does not think it will make the effort to do so because “they want to promote
      the message without actually having to do the work.” For her, the university uses
      diversity and inclusion as a selling point to potential students and their families.</p>

       <p>She finds that having faculty from minority groups helps to make her feel more
      comfortable in the classroom. “When you see someone like you in a position of
      power, you are able to relate to that,” Glover said. “It’s nice to learn from
      someone who you normally don’t see at the front of the classroom.”</p>

        professors that share her race while studying at UMD. (Megan Sayles/Journalism 352)<p>

      <p>With the appointment of Darryll J. Pines as the new university president,
      Glover hopes to see improvements in faculty diversity. Pines, a minority himself,
      is currently the dean of the university’s School of Engineering, and while holding
      this position, he has worked closely with diversity.</p>

      <p>“Under Dr. Pines’ leadership, the number of tenured and tenure-track women faculty
      in the Clark School has more than doubled, and the number of underrepresented minority
      faculty has grown as well,” <a href="https://umd.edu/presidential-search">according to an announcement from the University System of
      Maryland’s office of the chancellor.</a> Because young people spend most of their time in
      the education system, Glover thinks the faculty environment becomes a reflection of
      the world for them.</p>

      <p>“When you are used to mostly white teachers, that sets you up for when you are an
      adult because you are not used to seeing people of color in positions of power,” Glover said.</p>
